> Explore Providers and Services in Nest.js! Learn how to manage dependencies, create reusable logic, and write maintainable code.

## üí° Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Understand what providers are and how they work in Nest.js.
- Create and inject services into controllers.
- Use custom providers for more advanced use cases.
- Apply best practices for service-oriented architecture.

### üß© Injection Scopes

In Nest.js, understanding injection scopes is vital for managing the lifecycle of providers. Unlike the request/response Multi-Threaded Stateless Model found in some languages, Nest.js utilizes singleton instances shared across requests, making it fully safe for your applications.

However, Nest.js also offers flexibility with different provider scopes:

#### **1. DEFAULT (Singleton Scope)**

A single instance of the provider is shared across the entire application. The instance's lifetime is directly tied to the application lifecycle.

```typescript
// Singleton by default
@Injectable()
export class MyService { /* ... */ }
```

#### **2. REQUEST**

A new instance of the provider is created exclusively for each incoming request and is garbage-collected after the request has completed processing.

```typescript
// Per-request scope
@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class MyRequestScopedService { /* ... */ }
```

#### **3. TRANSIENT**

Transient providers are not shared across consumers. Each consumer that injects a transient provider will receive a new, dedicated instance.

```typescript
// Transient scope
@Injectable({ scope: Scope.TRANSIENT })
export class MyTransientService { /* ... */ }
```

Understanding these scopes is essential for scenarios like per-request caching in GraphQL applications, request tracking, and multi-tenancy.
